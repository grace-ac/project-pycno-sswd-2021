Rmd for compiling just the results I'll share on Thursday May 25, 2023 at PRWG meeting. 

Goal of what to share:
1. DEGs of healthy vs sick (all samples are ~1.5weeks after exp. start date)
Healthy PSC: 56, 81, 61, 76, 52, 54
Sick PSC: 59, 69, 75, 67, 78, 71
1a. heatmap showing differences in expression between these groups
2. Specific cool genes: any anti-viral? anti-bacterial? immune-related?
2a. Include interpretation of what that might mean
3. Pull out those genes and follow the pattern within individual star over time, if found. 
3a. can follow 2 time points of sick star (H04), or healthy stars H03 or H05.
