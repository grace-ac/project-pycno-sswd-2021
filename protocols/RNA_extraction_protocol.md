As of 2022-02-11 (sample PSC 025 onward) using columns from D7005 kit (designed for smaller sample input and can elute smaller volume for more concentrated RNA!)

### Sample information:
Coelomic cells of Pycnopodia helianthoides    
Samples were collected from stars using a sterile 1mL syringe and a sterile 20-25G needle       
Samples were spun down for 5 minutes at ~600rpm at room temperature and supernatant was discarded     
Cells were kept in 500ul RNAlater and stored at -80C


# Extraction Protocol   

## 1. Sample Preparation: 
Let samples warm on wet ice           
Spun at RT 5000g for 20 mins to pellet cells from RNAlater      
Removed supernatant     
Resuspended pellet in 600ul DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer - pipet to mix, vortex a few seconds           

Set heat block to 95C with nuclease-free H20 in an RNAse-free microcentrifuge tube

## 2a. DNA/RNA Purification:
Transferred resuspended cells in DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to yellow spin-away columns          
Centrifuge 16,000g 30s        
Put yellow column (DNA) in -20C      
Kept flow-through for RNA        
Add 1 volume (600ul) 100% molecular grade ethanol to collection tube and pipet to mix              
Run sample (600ul at a time) through green column       
Centrifuge 16,000g 30sec     
Discard flow through        

## 2b. DNAse Treatment:
After Step 2b above, Add 400ul Wash Buffer, centrifuge 16,000g 30sec, discard flowthrough    

Make DNAse treatment mix:

5 x 8rxns = 40ul DNAse I     
75 x 8rxns = 600ul DNA Digestion Buffer         

Mix by inversion     

Add 80 ul of DNAse I Treatment, let sit for 15min at RT - continue to Step 3 of purification
 
## 2c. DNA/RNA Purification (cont’d):
Add 400ul Prep Buffer       
Centrifuge 16,000g 30 sec, discard flowthrough       
Add 700ul Wash Buffer      
Centrifuge 16,000g 30 sec, discard flowthrough      
Add 400ul Wash Buffer      
Centrifuge 16,000g 2 mins, discard flowthrough      
Add 15ul of 95 C DNAse/RNase free water to column, let sit for 5 mins      
Centrifuge 16,000g for 30sec → RNA is in flowthrough      


## 3. RNA Quantitation
QUBIT (RNA HS Kit):

Run 2ul of sample on qubit… if too high, re-run with 1 ul or otherwise dilute a sample     

Qubit RNA HS dye was low/gone, so ran 1ul of sample on Nanodrop
